Each week we will discuss perspectives on how to move policy forward in consideration of these issues and develop a shared framework for policy gender analysis by the end of the course.

A thick accent, bunch of grammar errors, jumble of different languages, and so on: it feels embarrassing to speak “bad” English. We casually hear or say, “you speak very good English!” Is it a compliment or insult? What do we assume as “bad” and what counts as “good”? In this seminar, we will look into how different forms of English are represented and consumed in literature, film, video, and visual art, starting with the film Lost in Translation. Students are welcomed to bring in and share their own experiences on issues including “foreignness,” migration, language learning, and translation, to name but few. By focusing on how multiple Englishes meet and clash in fictional and real environments, we will try to rethink the hierarchies of language and culture.

In the aftermath of the Revolution (1910-1920), Mexican muralism emerged as the platform to promote ideals of social cohesion in a ravaged nation. In the throes of building a new national consciousness, Mexican artists deployed an avant-garde aesthetic that would influence muralist movements, and the forms of social critique associated to them, across the continent. With a historical perspective, we will study how muralism—an intervention of public space—supports struggles for representation through time. Paying special attention to Mexican, Chicano, and American artists—and to a lesser extent, Southern Cone and Caribbean artists—we will study how muralism combats multiple forms of oppression while addressing timely sociopolitical concerns. The course covers works from the early twentieth century to the present. Special one-time offering, spring 2021.\\nJuan Sebastian Ospina Leon'},\n",

Nature around us however only partially consists of hydrogen, e.g., in the chemical form of H2O or water, and a minute amount of helium, e.g., in balloons and particle accelerators. The majority of the remaining elements we are made of were formed in stars in various processes generally summarized under the term nucleosynthesis. In this course we will follow the evolution of the elements and isotopes from the Big Bang to today’s composition of the Solar System. We will discuss the basic physics behind these processes and look at astronomical observations and laboratory measurements of stardust grains that confirm current nucleosynthesis theories. In addition we will analyze open questions of this state-of-the-art research field to decipher what future measurements and observations will be required to solidify our understanding. This course will be a mixture between a classically taught course and a reading. Various topics and their underlying physics will be introduced on the (virtual) board. We will then read and discuss original scientific literature – historic articles and recent ones – to solidify the learned material. Usually offered every year.\\nReto Trappitsch'},\n",

Most of us would agree that infrastructure should be a public thing, serve society, and allow for better life, communication, and activity. Yet infrastructures are often hidden, subterranean, and therefore prone to exploitation and hijacking. The anthropology of infrastructure aims in part at making it more visible and at deciphering the complex interaction between things, society, and politics. But anthropologists end up unearthing more than utility networks and urbanism plans. They stumble upon the very power of inanimate things to orient our experiences, from the most intimate (having sex) to the least material of them (browsing the internet).

How do we define our relationship with animals: which we keep as livestock, which we keep as pets, and which we keep in zoos? Human-animal interactions have developed over hundreds of thousands of years; in that time, animals have had a significant impact on human behavior and on the development of human societies. In this class, we will explore the deep history of the relationship between humans and animals.

It will also cover the interplay between insurance, technology, and demand for health care and hence the risk of similar cost inflation in developing countries. Based on the lessons learned from industrialized world a series of evidence based advices for formulation of cost containment policies will follow.

Additionally it will enhance students’ knowledge in those areas that ordinary theories of microeconomics and health economics have not been able to provide convincing answers to real world phenomena.

The primary goal of this course is to teach current methods in molecular biology in order to establish a foundational skill set that makes a student viable in today's research market. Along with this, enhancing the written format of acquired data, the art of presenting this data and scientific writing is also emphasized. Though the course meets during its scheduled time, the experimental designs contribute to real research projects from laboratories in the Biology department so that additional work will be required during off days and weekends depending on your time management. This time commitment simulates a research environment where students are responsible for their own experiments in order to prepare them for both a career in science and allow them to fully understand what attributes are necessary to be competent in the field of research. Students will be required to perform tasks when the class is not in session. Some of the techniques taught will include DNA isolation, DNA sequence analysis, generation of mutations, recombinant DNA cloning, RNA isolation, polymerase chain reaction including real-time quantitative PCR, yeast two hybrid systems, screening chemical libraries, Gateway & Gibson cloning techniques, bacterial & yeast strain constructions and DNA/RNA hybridization methods. There is a possible option of continuing the project as an independent researcher in the spring depending on the student and nature of the project. Currently we are massing useable data from past classes for publication purposes. This class has a large time commitment both during and outside of class time and should not be taken in conjunction with other research laboratories or internships. Please note that one of the goals of this course is to help place you in or on the career path you desire. Usually offered every year. Usually offered every year.\\nVincent Sutera\"},\n",

Early internet theorists imagined the World Wide Web as a \"free\" society, where \"bodily\" issues such as race, gender, and disability would somehow disappear. However, these identities have not vanished; in fact, we might argue that they remain even more potent in today\\'s age of constant media connection. We will explore feminist theories of media, gender, sexuality, and race, as well as applying these theories to current events online. Students will explore the boundaries of digital activism, question the ways we continue to be embodied online, and consider power relations, discipline, and surveillance.

As students complete a series of writing assignments, they will engage in a process of reading, drafting, reviewing and revising, working in peer groups and individually with their instructors.  The development of social media, now so important in our lives, has caused huge changes in popular culture. It is now more democratic, more diverse, more open, and more political than ever before. Still, some of the same old problems persist. As noted intellectual Mary Beard argues, “there are countless examples of attempts to write women entirely out of public discourse.” Another prominent woman, lyricist, artist, businesswoman, and philanthropist Taylor Swift calls out this issue in simpler terms: “when everyone believes ya, what’s that like?” Beard and Swift both raise the same central question: who is allowed to speak in public, and who is believed? Furthermore, why do we see figures in popular culture as more or less credible than one another? What kind of identities (race, gender, or class) and social messages are involved in this process of divining the truth from multiple people’s perspectives? These are the questions at the heart of this course, which will focus on modern figures of popular culture—celebrities, politicians, activists, and fictional characters—to help us understand the complex relationship between truth and power.

As students complete a series of writing assignments, they will engage in a process of reading, drafting, reviewing and revising, working in peer groups and individually with their instructors. The Eurovision Song Contest is the longest-running competition in the world. Starting in 1956, it has been an opportunity for countries to showcase their talent by often playing on cultural traits and stereotypes. National identity plays a key factor in performances and can spark controversy, unity, or both. How can Eurovision help us understand the evolving role and significance of national identity? What is national identity and how is it used? What shapes, extends, and limits identity and how does this intersect with the nation? In this course we will look at some theories about nations and national identity, examine the performative aspects of identity, and, of course, enjoy some performances from the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest. For the final paper, students will explore and research a piece representative of a national identity, such as Disney’s Frozen or Hamilton the musical.

As students complete a series of writing assignments, they will engage in a process of reading, drafting, reviewing and revising, working in peer groups and individually with their instructors. In 2009, a woman was found murdered in rural Louisiana. There were no witnesses, but seeming evidence led police to suspect undocumented immigrants. The victim’s DNA, however, did not match any of the Mexican suspects. Years later a new forensic technology generated a portrait of the killer – a blonde male of Northern European ancestry, and an arrest was made. Forensic science has not only helped to identify the dead, to solve crimes, and to bring culprits to justice. Forensic techniques, accepted at the time but later discredited, have also led to false convictions, as in the case of a man found guilty of rape who spent decades in prison before DNA tests confirmed his innocence, or in the case of an arsonist who was exonerated by the State of Texas in 2011 but had been executed years earlier. This course invites students to explore the achievements and shortcomings of forensic science.  We will investigate the work of forensic anthropologists, take a look at real-life cases to learn about the history and effectiveness of investigative techniques, and analyze how forensic science has been portrayed (and transformed) in popular television series such as Bones, CSI, or Crossing Jordan.

We casually hear or say, “you speak very good English!” Is it a compliment or insult? What do we assume as “bad” and what counts as “good”? In this seminar, we will look into how different forms of English are represented and consumed in literature, film, video, and visual art, starting with the film Lost in Translation. Students are welcomed to bring in and share their own experiences on issues including “foreignness,” migration, language learning, and translation, to name but few.

How does one politically persuade an often hostile audience? How is one’s personal history and sense of identity influenced by historical, political, and cultural circumstances?

As students complete a series of writing assignments, they will engage in a process of reading, drafting, reviewing and revising, working in peer groups and individually with their instructors. Joey and Chandler, Woody and Buzz, Thelma and Louise, Hermoine and Harry: over the years, television and movies have provided numerous definitions of “friendship” through various depictions of “besties” and “bosom-buddies.” These definitions naturally reflect the changing societal values and cultural norms from which they emerge. The same can be said for depictions about friendship from the ancient world. The relationships between Ruth and Naomi, Gilgamesh and Enkidu, David and Jonathan, or Achilles and Patroclus can provide rich insight into the boundaries of friendship that still hold true today. In this course, we will consider numerous depictions of friendship and consider what assumptions they convey in their time and place. Through reading a novel or short story from popular culture or the ancient world, watching a television episode of Friends or Black Mirror, or critically examining a movie like Toy Story or Clueless, we will seek answers to questions like: What are the benefits of friendship? What role does gender play in friendship? What do friendship-depictions tell us about how audiences view and participate in friendship? Our understanding will be facilitated through modern studies of friendship from psychology, sociology, and anthropology. Through engagement with primary source material in combination with class discussions, we will learn analytic and writing skills that will enable us to think critically about what it means to be a friend.

What is love? How does society encourage or discourage it? Who gets to fall in love and why? For many years, the study of love seemed to belong to poets, painters, singers, and playwrights. Scholars in different fields like history and anthropology avoided studying love, claiming that it was too special—too personal, maybe too sacred—to be a topic of reflection and analysis. Yet love is all around us. What does it mean and do? This course explores films, case studies, and more to explore how love conforms to and challenges the prevailing social order and becomes a force for change or continuity. We will analyze readings about how people living in Africa, the USA, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East have described and experienced love as a vital emotion within or despite the expectations they face.

As students complete a series of writing assignments, they will engage in a process of reading, drafting, reviewing and revising, working in peer groups and individually with their instructors. In 2009, a woman was found murdered in rural Louisiana. There were no witnesses, but seeming evidence led police to suspect undocumented immigrants. The victim’s DNA, however, did not match any of the Mexican suspects. Years later a new forensic technology generated a portrait of the killer – a blonde male of Northern European ancestry, and an arrest was made. Forensic science has not only helped to identify the dead, to solve crimes, and to bring culprits to justice. Forensic techniques, accepted at the time but later discredited, have also led to false convictions, as in the case of a man found guilty of rape who spent decades in prison before DNA tests confirmed his innocence, or in the case of an arsonist who was exonerated by the State of Texas in 2011 but had been executed years earlier. This course invites students to explore the achievements and shortcomings of forensic science.  We will investigate the work of forensic anthropologists, take a look at real-life cases to learn about the history and effectiveness of investigative techniques, and analyze how forensic science has been portrayed (and transformed) in popular television series such as Bones, CSI, or Crossing Jordan.

In the 1970s, the battle cry, “You’ve come a long way, Baby!” pushed cigarettes as the hip accessories of feminism and the sexual revolution. Today, brands blend consumerism with gender activism, invite LGBTQ to the mainstream marketplace, and tempt millennials with new promises of sex and success. In this course, students find and write about advertising that delights, infuriates, and perplexes them. In the first essay, they dissect their choice of pornographic food commercials, Budweiser bromances, and Calvin Klein billboards that titillate consumers and reshape social constructs of masculinity and femininity. The research paper challenges students to locate and comprehend recent studies of sex and gender in advertising and apply them to a defined set of ads or a major campaign of their choice.
